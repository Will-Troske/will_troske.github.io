I am a PhD Candidate in Agriculture and Resource Economics at UC Davis. My work focuses on the behavioral responses to environmental regulations in various contexts. 
My dissertation studies the impact of a US fuel content regulation on the ships serving in US trade. 

Before coming to Davis, I worked as a process engineer in the electroplating industry. I earned an MA in Economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison 
and a BSE in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan.
